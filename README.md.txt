This project utilizes AngularJS, MongoDB, Express, and NodeJS. The project has login vaildation after you register your name. Once logged in, the user can make an appoitment. All appointments must be made for the current date or after. Error messages are present during the process of making an appointment. The user can also cancel their personal appointments and log out. AngularJS is used in the front end and Express is used for the back end. MongoDB is used for the database and it is a NoSQL database. I also utilize Mongoose to have the back end communicate with the database.
